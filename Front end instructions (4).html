		<h1>Front End Developer Applicants Test</h1>

		<p>
		To understand your coding ability and style, we have devised a simple practical coding test. 
		<br>
		We use this as a dicussion topic during interviews and may use it as a sample of your knowledge when presenting your profile to customers.
		</p>

		<h3>Objective:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Make <a href="data.json">this data</a> searchable with <a href="SearchDevv.psd">this design</a> (break it into HTML and CSS)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Minimum requirements:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Implementation must use HTML, CSS and JavaScript (all three)</li>
			<li>Design implemented as per attached PSD</li>
			<li>Use AJAX, no search button. </li>
			<li>Search logic should be implemented in JavaScript</li>
			<li>A search for <code>Lisp Common</code> should match a programming language named &quot;Common Lisp&quot;</li>
			<li>Your solution will be tested on a server running Ubuntu, <b>Apache 2.4.7</b> and PHP 5.5</li>
			<li>Deliver your solution as a zip or tar.gz file</li>
			<li>We will unpack your solution and run it from http://ourserver/yourname/</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Meriting:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Writing code with reusability in mind</li>
			<li>Search match precision</li>
			<li>Search results ordered by relevance</li>
			<li>
				Support for exact matches, eg. <code>Interpreted &quot;Thomas Eugene&quot;</code>, which should match
				&quot;BASIC&quot;, but not &quot;Haskell&quot;
			</li>
			<li>Match in different fields, eg. <code>Scripting Microsoft</code> should return all scripting languages designed by &quot;Microsoft&quot;</li>
			<li>Support for negative searches, eg. <code>john -array</code>, which should match &quot;BASIC&quot;, &quot;Haskell&quot;, &quot;Lisp&quot; and &quot;S-Lang&quot;, but not &quot;Chapel&quot;, &quot;Fortran&quot; or &quot;S&quot;.</li>
			<li>Solution elegance</li>
			<li>Visual design</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Keep in mind:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>TEST YOUR SOLUTION! Seriously, if it doesn't work when uploaded, you have failed</li>
			<li>
				Frameworks are allowed and encouraged, but not required.
				<ul>
					<li>If you use a framework, please do not include the framework code. Write instructions allowing us to install the framework by ourselves (and where to add your code).</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Comments are VERY useful, they help us understand your thought process</li>
			<li>This exercise is <b>not</b> meant to take more than a <b>few hours</b> (usually 3-5 hours)</li>
			<li>A readme file is encouraged</li>
			<li>PHP may be used in conjunction with JS</li>
		</ul>
